# Comparative Analysis of Image Inpainting on MNIST Dataset using Generative Adversarial Network and Convolutional Neural Tangent Kernel

This repository contains two implementations for image inpainting on the MNIST dataset. One uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), while the other employs a Convolutional Neural Tangent Kernel (CNTK). This README provides detailed instructions to set up, run, and evaluate the models.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You will also need the following libraries:

```bash
pip install kaggle matplotlib mpld3 scikit-image tensorflow huggingface_hub
```
